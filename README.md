  ```bash
  DB_HOST=localhost
  DB_USER=root
  DB_NAME=victrees
  DB_PASS=YOURPASSWORD
  ```

  - Replace `YOURPASSWORD` with your actual password
    Go to MySQL CLI and type the password that you have created.

(If unable to do so, run the following in the MySQL CLI: `ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD';` (replace `YOUR_PASSWORD` with a new password))

Run `npm run migrate` in the main folder of this repository, in a new terminal window. This will create tables of the victrees database with some dummy data.
